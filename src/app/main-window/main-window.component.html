            <h5>Installation</h5>
            <p>To get started with the node-based package management system for autonomous boats, follow these steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Install the package management system by running the appropriate installation command for your system. This will typically involve downloading and extracting the package, and possibly setting up any dependencies.</li>
                <li>Once the package management system is installed, launch it by running the appropriate command. This will open the main interface, which consists of a canvas where you can drag and drop nodes to create a graphical representation of your package dependencies.</li>
                <li>To add a package to your project, drag a node from the "Available Packages" list onto the canvas. This will create a new node representing the package, and will automatically resolve any dependencies that the package has.</li>
                <li>To create a relationship between two nodes, click and drag a line from one node to another. This will create a connection between the two nodes, indicating that one package depends on the other.</li>
                <li>As you add more nodes and create relationships between them, the package management system will automatically resolve any conflicts or issues, ensuring that all of your packages are properly installed and configured.</li>
                <li>When you're ready to install all of the packages in your project, click the "Install" button. The package management system will handle the process of downloading and installing all of the necessary packages, as well as any required dependencies.</li>
                <li>Once the installation process is complete, you can start using the packages in your project. The package management system will keep track of all of your installed packages and their dependencies, making it easy to manage and update your project as needed.</li>
            </ol>

            <h5>Use</h5>
            <p>To use the node-based package management system after installation, you will need to create a graphical representation of your package dependencies by dragging and dropping nodes onto the canvas. Each node represents a package, and the connections between the nodes indicate relationships between the packages.</p>
            <p>Here are some specific steps you can follow to use the package management system:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Launch the package management system by running the appropriate command. This will open the main interface, which consists of a canvas where you can drag and drop nodes to create a graphical representation of your package dependencies.</li>
                <li>To add a package to your project, drag a node from the "Available Packages" list onto the canvas. This will create a new node representing the package, and will automatically resolve any dependencies that the package has.</li>
                <li>To create a relationship between two nodes, click and drag a line from one node to another. This will create a connection between the two nodes, indicating that one package depends on the other.</li>
                <li>As you add more nodes and create relationships between them, the package management system will automatically resolve any conflicts or issues, ensuring that all of your packages are properly installed and configured.</li>
                <li>When you're ready to install all of the packages in your project, click the "Install" button. The package management system will handle the process of downloading and installing all of the necessary packages, as well as any required dependencies.</li>
